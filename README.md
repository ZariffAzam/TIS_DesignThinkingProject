# Design Thinking Project - Handy Lingua

For our Design thinking project, my team and I developed Handy Lingua - an app designed to aid in communication with the deaf and hard-of-hearing community. Handy Lingua translates sign language into texts and vice versa, ehile also providing a platform where users can learn sign language at their own pace.

Being part of a project developing a sign language translation app has been an eye-opening and rewarding experience. Throughout this journey, I’ve gained valuable insights into both the technical and human aspects of creating assistive technology.

One of the biggest takeaways has been understanding the importance of accessibility and inclusivity in tech development. I learned that designing for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing community requires more than just translating words—it involves recognizing the cultural nuances, gestures, and unique grammatical structures of sign languages.

On the technical side, I developed a deeper understanding of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. Working on training models to recognize and interpret sign language gestures gave me a new appreciation for the complexities of AI in accessibility solutions.

Overall, this project has strengthened my problem-solving skills and reinforced my passion for using technology to break communication barriers. It has been an incredible learning experience, and I’m excited to see how this app can make a real impact in bridging the gap between sign language users and the hearing world.
